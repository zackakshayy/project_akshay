Goal: 
Research Question 1 (RQ1): Finding the predictors contributing significantly in firm
bankruptcy
There are total 66 ratios considered for this study which have been divided into four
constructs. Here, I aim to pinpoint the most significant ratios which lead to
bankruptcy of a company when their values get imbalanced.

Research Question 2 (RQ2): Finding the best algorithm for highest prediction accuracy
This is a classification problem with binary dependent variable. There are multiple algorithms
such as logistic regression, na√Øve bayes, tree based ensemble methods can be used. Thus
study attempts to do a comparative study among all to find out the best possible technique for
this problem.
